<p>
  The <em>Swedish Pathogens Portal</em> provides information about available
  datasets, resources, tools, and services related to pandemic preparedness in
  Sweden. We offer support to all those involved in pandemic preparedness
  research that are affiliated with a Swedish research institution or
  university.
</p>
<p>
  The Portal is operated by the
  <a href="https://scilifelab.se/data/">SciLifeLab Data Centre</a> and
  <a href="/about/partner_organisations/">partners</a>. We welcome community
  contributions to the Portal and provide information on the different ways that
  the community can contribute, for more details see
  <a href="/contribute/">contribute</a> page. In addition to running the Portal,
  the team can also either provide support on data-related questions surrounding
  pandemic preparedness research or help find suitable support services. For
  more general data support, please see our related research data management
  service(<a href="https://data-guidelines.scilifelab.se/">RDM Guidelines</a>).

<h4 id="history-of-the-portal">History of the Portal</h4>
<p>
  The Swedish Pathogens Portal was originally launched as the ‘Swedish COVID-19
  Data Portal in June 2020 on assignment and with funding from the Swedish
  Research Council a.k.a. Vetenskapsrådet (more details
  <a
    href="https://www.vr.se/english/just-now/news/news-archive/2020-06-03-new-national-portal-makes-research-data-on-covid-19-accessible.html"
    >here</a
  >). The Portal was actually the first national node of the
  <a href="https://covid19dataportal.eu/">European COVID-19 Data Platform</a>,
  which was initiated and funded by the European Commission (more details
  <a
    href="https://www.embl.org/news/science/embl-ebi-launches-covid-19-data-portal/"
    >here</a
  >) and you can find an overview of other national nodes
  <a href="/other_national_portals/">here</a>. The Portal focused on SARS-CoV-2
  and COVID-19 research data exclusively until the end of 2021. We released a
  <a href="/updates/first_year/">news item</a> summarising our activities in
  2021.
</p>
<p>
  From 2022, the Portal expanded to cover other research relevant to pandemic
  preparedness and became a part of the
  <a
    href="https://www.scilifelab.se/pandemic-response/pandemic-laboratory-preparedness/"
    >SciLifeLab Pandemic Laboratory Preparedness programme</a
  >. The SciLifeLab Pandemic Laboratory Preparedness Programme is funded by the
  earmarked governmental funding to SciLifeLab (<a

    >Research proposition Prop. 202/21:60</a
  >).
</p>
<p>
  From the start, the Portal has been operated by the SciLifeLab Data Centre and
  partners. However, it has received considerable input from the community.
  Indeed, many people contributed to building the initial site, and to content
  throughout. An overview of some of the contributors that have been
  instrumental to establishing and advancing the Portal can be found on
