        <p>In line with the principles of <em>FAIR</em> and <em>Open Science</em>, we encourage the reuse and recognition of material made available on the Swedish Pathogens Portal. On this page, you will find information about how to cite the portal when reusing and referencing the content. Please note that the information on the portal is updated continuously, therefore it is important to refer to specific versions (or to provide access dates) within citations.</p>

        <p>In this section, you’ll find instructions on how to cite the portal website, or underlying code, in research publications.</p>

        <h5>Research Resource Identifier of Swedish Pathogens Portal</h5>
        <p>The Resource Identification Portal was created in support of the <a href="https://rrids.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resource Identification Initiative</a>. It aims to promote the identification, discovery, and reuse of research resources. Research Resource Identifiers (<strong>RRIDs</strong>) are persistent and unique identifiers for referencing a research resource.</p>
        <p>The RRID for the Swedish Pathogens Portal is <a href="https://scicrunch.org/resources/data/record/nlx_144509-1/SCR_024866/resolver?q=SCR_024866&amp;l=SCR_024866&amp;i=rrid:scr_024866"><strong>SCR_024866</strong></a>.</p>
        <p>By citing the portal using the RRID, you will facilitate further reuse of the portal, enable us to track that activity, and allow others to easily find the <em>Summary Report</em> for usage of the Swedish Pathogens Portal.</p>

        <h5>APA format (WIP)</h5>
        <p>For official guidance see the <a href="https://scicrunch.org/resources/about/guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SciCrunch page on RRID citations</a>.</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
            <li><strong>In-text citation</strong>: Swedish Pathogens Portal, SciLifeLab Data Centre, <em>version number</em>, RRID: SCR_024866. (Access date: <em>date of access</em>).</li>
            <li><strong>Reference list</strong>: Swedish Pathogens Portal (<em>access date</em>), SciLifeLab Data Centre, version (<em>version number</em>) from <a href="https://www.pathogens.se" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.pathogens.se</a>, RRID:SCR_024866.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You will find the version number of the portal at the bottom of the footer on any page, or on our <a href="https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/swedish-pathogens-portal/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">swedish-pathogens-portal GitHub repository</a> under ‘releases’.</p>
        <p>If you are aiming to cite particular pages of the portal in particular (e.g. the Data Highlights), you may find that an author is mentioned and a date is given. In this case, you should include the appropriate date and author instead, but must still include the RRID. There are also some pages were information for how to cite the data itself is provided (e.g. where a DOI is given on a dashboard page). In those cases, you should use that citation.</p>

        <h4 id="citing-underlying-code">Citing underlying code</h4>
        <p>The portal is operated by the <a href="https://scilifelab.se/data" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SciLifeLab Data Centre</a> and partners. Many individuals from the wider community have also contributed to the code over time. All of the source code used on the website is available on GitHub. The code used to produce the website is available in our <a href="https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/swedish-pathogens-portal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">swedish-pathogens-portal repository</a>. All of the code that we have produced is available for reuse under an MIT licence.</p>
